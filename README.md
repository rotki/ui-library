# How to test the usage locally.
After you build the bundle, in the `package.json` on your main project, you can add this to the dependencies:

```json
{
  "@rotki/ui-library": "file:...path_of_this_directory"
}
```

When the dependency installed on the main project, it will run the `postinstall` script.

Don't forget to import the `style.css` file from `@rotki/ui-library` in the project root (e.g main.ts)

```typescript
import '@rotki/ui-library/dist/style.css';
```

Also, import the library plugin use:

Vue 3
```typescript
import { RuiPlugin } from "@rotki/ui-library";

...

app.use(RuiPlugin, options);
```

And then you can use the component 
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RuiButton } from '@rotki/ui-library';
</script>

<template>
  <VContainer>
    <RuiButton outlined>This is button</RuiButton>
  </VContainer>
</template>
```

after complete setup, we can then use the theme manager as:

```typescript
const { toggleThemeMode, setThemeConfig, switchThemeScheme, state, store } = useRotkiTheme();

// to change the theme (pass colors as described by `ThemeConfig`) anytime:
setThemeConfig(newTheme);

// to switch between auto|light|dark
toggleThemeMode();

// to switch to a specific theme mode
switchThemeScheme(ThemeMode.dark);
```


# Use icons
We use remix-icons. You need to run this script to scrap the svgs data from remix-icons. (This script runs automatically on `postinstall`. Run this in case the icons aren't generated properly)
```
pnpm run generate:icons
```

You need to specify which icons you want to enable, when installing the RuiPlugin.
```typescript
import { Ri4kFill, Ri4kLine, RuiPlugin } from '@rotki/ui-library';

Vue.use(RuiPlugin, {
  icons: [Ri4kFill, Ri4kLine]
});
```

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { RuiIcon } from '@rotki/ui-library';
</script>

<template>
  <VContainer>
    <RuiIcon name="4k-fill" />
    <RuiIcon name="4k-line" />
  </VContainer>
</template>
```
