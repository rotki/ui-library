# @rotki/ui-library

A vue component library and design system for rotki

### Installation

To install the dependencies you need to run on the root of the repository

```
pnpm install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
The following command when executed from the project root will build the `@rotki/ui-library` bundle.
This command will create the bundle for both Vue version 2.7 and 3.
```
pnpm run build:prod
```

If you want to build for specific version, you can run:
```
pnpm run build:v2
pnpm run build:v3
```

by default if you run this command, it will build the package for version 2, the version that installed by default in this package
```
pnpm run build
```

### Lint check
```
pnpm run lint
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
pnpm run lint:fix
```

# Storybook
In order to run the storybook, you can run:

```
pnpm run storybook
```

# How to test the usage locally.
After you build the bundle, in the `package.json` on your main project, you can add this to the dependencies:

```json
{
  "@rotki/ui-library": "file:...path_of_this_directory"
}
```

When the dependency installed on the main project, it will run the `postinstall` script to determine which dist version will be used, based on the Vue version on the main project.

Don't forget to import the `style.css` file from `@rotki/ui-library` in the project root (e.g main.ts)

```typescript
import '@rotki/ui-library/dist/style.css';
```

Also, import the library plugin and use, depending on app version:

Vue 2
```typescript
import { RuiPlugin } from "@rotki/ui-library";

...

Vue.use(RuiPlugin, {});
```

Vue 3
```typescript
import { RuiPlugin } from "@rotki/ui-library";

...

app.use(RuiPlugin, options);
```

And then you can use the component 
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RuiButton } from '@rotki/ui-library';
</script>

<template>
  <v-container>
    <rui-button label="This is button" outlined />
  </v-container>
</template>
```

after complete setup, we can then use the theme manager as:

```typescript
const { toggleThemeMode, setThemeConfig, switchThemeScheme, state, store } = useRotkiTheme();

// to change the theme (pass colors as described by `ThemeConfig`) anytime:
setThemeConfig(newTheme);

// to switch between auto|light|dark
toggleThemeMode();

// to switch to a specific theme mode
switchThemeScheme(ThemeMode.dark);
```
